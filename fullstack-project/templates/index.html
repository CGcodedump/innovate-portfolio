            <h3>Casual Content</h3>
            <p>Casual content could be anything from hanging out at the FC estate, talking to people in FC chat or running low effort content as a group. We're a social bunch and there's normally something happening at any hour of the day. If you want help with progressing in your story dungeons, knowing how to build a triple triad deck or help with your fashion (the true endgame, if we're being real) there's always gonna be someone eager to lend a hand.</p>
